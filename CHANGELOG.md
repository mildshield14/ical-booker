## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 Highlights

This initial release focuses on providing a robust, easy-to-use CalDAV client that handles the complexity of calendar discovery and busy time checking. The library has been tested with major CalDAV providers and includes comprehensive error handling for production use.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Simplified Integration**: No need to understand CalDAV protocols - just provide credentials
- **Provider Agnostic**: Works with any RFC 4791 compliant CalDAV server
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **TypeScript First**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support
- **Modern Architecture**: ESM modules, async/await, and clean APIs

**What's Next:**
- Enhanced recurrence rule support
- Batch operations for multiple calendars
- Real-time change notifications
- Calendar sync capabilities
- Performance optimizations

### Migration Guide

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. For future versions, migration guides will be provided here.

### Breaking Changes

None for initial release.

### Security Notes

- Always use app-specific passwords instead of main account passwords
- Store credentials securely using environment variables or secure credential stores
- Validate all user inputs before passing to CalDAV functions
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts in production environments

### Known Issues

- iCloud partition auto-detection may require manual URL adjustment for some accounts
- Some CalDAV servers may have rate limiting that affects bulk operations
- Timezone handling relies on server-provided information
